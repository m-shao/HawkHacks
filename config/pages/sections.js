    text: `A MongoDB schema describes the structure of your data. It's like a blueprint for your documents (similar to rows in a table), specifying fields like "name" or "age." MongoDB offers flexibility â€“ you don't need a strict schema and can store different data types within a collection. However, you can add validation rules to maintain consistency and prevent invalid entries. This adaptability makes MongoDB suitable for applications with evolving data requirements.`,
